  "description": "Espresso disables the usual auto suspend and screensaver functionality and optionally Night Light with options to show an Espresso icon in the top panel, to enable Espresso when a fullscreen application is running, to restore state across reboots, to provide notifications, to enable Espresso when specific applications are running, or to pause Night Light when Espresso is enabled or only when specific applications are running. Espresso also provides some support for docking stations including options to enable Espresso when charging and/or when docked to external monitors and to allow temporarily overriding the docking support without affecting the stored state.\n\nEspresso is a fork of the Caffeine extension.\n\nPlease leave feedback or report issues through the Extension Homepage",
